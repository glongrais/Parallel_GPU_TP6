Lab 6 for the PPAR Parallel Programming course at [Université de Rennes 1](https://www.univ-rennes1.fr/).

## Principle

The objective of this lab assignment is to implement a 2-player version of [Conway’s Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)

## Task

We consider a 2-dimensional domain composed of ````domain x```` × ````domain y cells. Each cell can be either red, blue, or empty. The domain has a torus shape: the right neighbor of the rightmost cell is the leftmost cell.
Each cell has 8 neighbors in the adjacent cells. At each time step, all cells evolve according to the following rules:
